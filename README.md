[## A (semi) interactive history of web design!](https://smeasly.github.io)

## About This Project
This project was originally an assignment for an IT diploma program - How does this fit?
This is a showcase of some of the designs that I appreciate, and some that I detest.
Lots of fun - etc.

## Pages
 - **Main Index**
 Modern, flat web design - My approximation of what we see today
 - **Geoscape**
 The kitschy design of the 90s to the early 2000s
 - **Two-Point-Oh**
 The early attempts at *sleek and future-forward* design
 - **The Future...**
 A taste of what the *terrifying* future may hold

## Attributions and Sources
I did not create - from scratch - everything in these pages. Especially the images
I've tried to collect all the sources used during this project - from source markup to resources.
Many of these are also linked directly in the pages - if you want to go looking :)

#### Inspiration

## Changelog
Under construction!
