A (semi) interactive (and incomplete) history of web design!

## About This Project
This project was originally an assignment for an IT diploma program - How does this fit into IT? Well, because it's fun.
This is basically a showcase of some of the web designs that I appreciate, and some that I don't.
I want to expand this as a personal side project for fun, and hopefully find a better hosting solution (myself or a service that supports more than static pages)
This may also become a sub-set of an expanded pages project once I have the need to showcase information for other repositories.

## Pages
 - **Main Index**: 
 Modern, flat web design - My approximation of what we see today
 - **Neoscape Navigator**: 
 Your portal into the past
 - **Geoscape**: 
 The kitschy design of the 90s to the early 2000s
 - **Two-Point-Oh**: 
 The early attempts at *sleek and future-forward* design
 - **The Future...**: 
 A taste of what the *terrifying* future may hold

## Attributions, Inspiration, and Sources
I did not create from scratch everything in these pages. Especially many images
I've tried to collect at least the major sources used in this.
Many of these are also linked directly in the pages - if you want to go looking :)

#### Inspiration
I collected a lot of inspiration for this, which I link to within the pages as well, but here's some big ones:
 - [www.cameronsworld.net](https://www.cameronsworld.net) - A love letter to GeoCities

#### Assets and Source Markup/Content
I'll try to list actual resources for assets and markup that I borrowed here as I remember them:
 - I created a few of the images myself, but many of them I stole straight from the depths of [GifCities](https://gifcities.org) and many more from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org)
 - The interface UI [Icons](https://archive.org/details/github.com-grassmunk-Chicago95_Extras_-_2021-02-23_17-07-06) from [The Chigago95 XFCE spin](https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95/tree/master)
 - The Neoscape UI (though not in whole, I added icons and the interactive elements with JS) was from [netscape.html - A simple netscape UI in HTML](https://gist.github.com/opaeoh/5fcdadb5bb2f701c7a5a94d79f97f856) by [opaeoh](https://github.com/opaeoh)


## To-Do
 - Add a lot more content
 - Finish up some unfinished/rough pages
 - Expand the function of Neoscape and add some era-appropriate icons
 - Get iframe content in Neoscape to respond to resizing - currently responsiveness is not functional within the iframe.
 - Fix iframe content height breaking on page-changes

## Changelog
#### 25/12/18
 - External links in Neoscape now escape Neoscape and load in the main browser
 - Added extra context to some unclear elements
 - Fixed W3C validation on Neoscape about page
